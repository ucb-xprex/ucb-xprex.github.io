## Quasi-2D Silo
The quasi-2D silo is a classic geometry for granular flow experiments. The XPREX quasi-2D silo can be setup for both converging and diverging geometries. 

## Cylindrical Silo
The cylindrical silo is a common geometry for a small pebble-bed test reactor core. XPREX is currently running tests with a cylindrical silo scaled to match the SINAP TMSR-SF1 core.

## Control Blade Insertion Experiment (CoBIE)
CoBIE is designed to study direct control blade insertion in a pebble-bed core. CoBIE measures blade insertion forces in order to ensure that pebble fuel mechanical integrity is not compromised during a shutdown event.
